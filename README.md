# 👋 Hi

My name is Guido Iaquinti and I define myself as a curious human, always eager to learn new things.

Professional wise, I'm an engineer with an academic background and experience in high volume/high availability Internet architectures. I'm a technology enthusiast excited about open source software. My passion is to develop, scale, and automate complex systems.

## About me

* 🇮🇹 Italian living in Barcelona (Spain 🇪🇸). In the past, I've also lived in Dublin (Ireland), Berlin (Germany), and Auckland (New Zealand).
* ⛵ Sailor, former member of the national Italian sailing team and a certified sailing instructor. In 2018, I crossed the Atlantic Ocean on a 10 m / 34 ft sailboat.
* 🥾 In 2018, I completed a solo hiking trip, starting in France and arriving at the end of Spain covering about 730 km / 450 miles in around 20 days.
* 🏔️ In 2019, I climbed [Mount Kilimanjaro](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro) (5,895 m / 19,341 ft above sea level) via the Lemosho Route.
* 👨‍💻 My working experience spans from little startups to multi-billion dollar companies. Lately, I was lucky enough to be one of the founding members of the technical operations team at [Slack](https://slack.com).
* 💪 I love challenges and throw myself in difficult situations.
* 💡 I'm always interested in learning something new (in both tech and non-tech fields).
